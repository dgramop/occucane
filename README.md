# Occucane

A ultrasonic augmented cane for the visually impaired

## Why Occucane?

Many visually impaired rely on canes for navigation, as they have for thousands of years. Occucane is a small but impactful augmentation on this daily-use item. 

Unlike other alternatives, the user does not have to fully trust or rely on our technology. If for some reason the Occucane augmentation fails, the fallback is just a regular cane.

# What does it do?
Occucane scans the area in just in front of the cane for obstacles. The cane user uses the cane normally, and is alerted about nearby objects (so they don't have to actually touch everything with their cane to know about its presence)

This can save the visually impaired time and potentially allow them to walk faster and more confidently, and get lost less.
